# Pairwise alignment

The script alignes two strings using [Needlman-Wunsh algorythm](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%90%D0%BB%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BC_%D0%9D%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%BB%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0_%E2%80%94_%D0%92%D1%83%D0%BD%D1%88%D0%B0).
Any strings (nucleotides, amino acids or random symbols) can be aligned. Score for match +1, for mismatch and gap -1. 

The program could be runned from terminal by following command:
``` bash
python3 align.py seq1 seq2
 ```
 
 Use -w flag to show distance matrix. 
 
 **Enjoy your alignment!**
